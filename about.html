    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about-container">
        <p>Hello there!</p>
        <p>I'm Elliot, a dedicated and passionate individual currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) at The University of Adelaide.</p>
        <p>Ever since my early years, coding has held a certain allure for me, and I've always been drawn to the intricacies of this beautiful digital language. As a child, I was captivated by the world of computers and programming, largely fueled by the mesmerizing portrayals of coding in films like The Matrix and Tron. These movies didn't merely entertain me; they sparked a fascination within me, inciting a profound curiosity about the intricate world of code and its infinite possibilities.</p>
        <p>I am captivated by the unique blend of creativity and logic that coding entails, and more specifically, by the emotional journey it promises. There's a unique thrill that courses through me every time I sit down to solve a problem - a heady mix of challenge, frustration, determination, and finally, the unparalleled joy of triumph. It's akin to the experience of solving a complex puzzle, where the satisfaction derived from each solved piece gradually builds up to the euphoria of seeing the completed picture.</p>
        <p>The moment when a LeetCode problem that has been tirelessly worked on for hours finally clicks into place is a feeling of elation that I find difficult to put into words. It's not just about the solution; it's about the journey taken to reach it. Coding, to me, is not merely about arriving at the correct output; it's a voyage of discovery, of learning, of growing.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, there's the inevitable frustration that sometimes accompanies coding, like when you're knee-deep in debugging, meticulously trawling through lines of code to identify that elusive bug. It's a process that tests your patience, persistence, and problem-solving skills. And yet, it's this very challenge that makes the victory all the more rewarding.</p>
        <p>It's this rollercoaster of emotions, this continuous cycle of struggle and success, that makes me believe coding is one of the most rewarding professions in the world. It's not just a job for me; it's a passion, an adventure, and a lifelong journey of continuous learning and growth. I look forward to bringing this passion, combined with the skills and knowledge I've gained from my studies, to the world of technology and programming.</p>
